; NAME:         SKEY_IBM
; PURPOSE:      Under Unix, the number of function keys, their names, and the
;               escape sequences they send to the host computer vary
;               enough between various keyboards that IDL cannot be
;               written to understand all keyboards. Therefore, it provides
;               a very general routine named DEFINE_KEY that allows the
;               user to specify the names and escape sequences. This
;               routine uses DEFINE_KEY to enter the keys for a Sun 
;		keyboard.
;
;               Note: SKEY_IBM is primarily designed to be called by
;               SETUP_KEYS, which attempts to automatically detect the 
;		correct
;               keyboard type in use, and define the keys accordingly.
;               Nonetheless, SKEY_IBM may be called as a standalone
;               routine.
