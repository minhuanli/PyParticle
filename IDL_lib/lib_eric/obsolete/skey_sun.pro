; NAME:
;	SKEY_SUN
;
; PURPOSE:
;	Under Unix, the number of function keys, their names, and the
;	escape sequences they send to the host computer vary
;	enough between various keyboards that IDL cannot be
;	written to understand all keyboards. Therefore, it provides
;	a very general routine named DEFINE_KEY that allows the
;	user to specify the names and escape sequences. This
;	routine uses DEFINE_KEY to enter the keys for a Sun keyboard.
;
;	Note: SKEY_SUN is primarily designed to be called by
;	SETUP_KEYS, which attempts to automatically detect the correct
;	keyboard type in use, and define the keys accordingly.
;	Nonetheless, SKEY_SUN can be called as a standalone
;	routine.
;
; CATEGORY:
;	Misc.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	SKEY_SUN
;
; INPUTS:
;	None.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;	None.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;	None.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	None.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;	The definitions for the function keys have been entered, and
;	can be viewed using the command HELP, /KEYS .
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;	AB, 26 April 1989
;	TJA, July 1990, SETUP_KEYS_SUN created by the "breakup" of SETUP_KEYS
;			into separate files.
;	AB, 21 September 1992,renamed from SETUP_KEYS_SUN to SKEY_SUN to
;		avoid DOS filename limitations.
;	AB, 16 June 1993, The IDL scanner used to treat octal string escapes
;		in a manner similar to the C language, but this ability was
;		removed to make the MS DOS port possible (conflicts with
;		file path specifications). Removed all uses of that here.
;	AB, 5 March 1997, The psterm doesn't exist anymore, so I changed the
;		routine to accept the PSTERM keyword and silently ignore it.
