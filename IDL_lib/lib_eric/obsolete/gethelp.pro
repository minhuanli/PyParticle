; NAME:
;	 GETHELP
;
; PURPOSE:
;	This function is used to get information on variables in the 
;	routine that called this function. The function builts a string array
;	that contains information that follows the format that is used
;	by the IDL HELP command. 
;
; CATEGORY:
;	Help
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	Result = GetHelp([Vname])
;
; INPUTS:
;	Vname:	Optional parameter that contains the name of a variable
;		the user wants information about.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;	ONELINE:	If a variable name is greater than 15 charaters
;			it is usally returned as 2 two elements of the
;			output array (Variable name in 1st element, 
;			variable info in the 2nd element). Setting this 
;			keyword will put all the information in one string,
;			seperating the name and  data with a space.
;
;	FULLSTRING:	Normally a string that is longer than 45 chars
;			is truncated and followed by "..." just like 
;			the HELP command. Setting this keyword will cause
;			the full string to be returned.
;
;	PROCEDURES:	Setting this keyword will cause the function
;			to return all current IDL compiled procedures.
;
;	FUNCTIONS:	Setting this keyword will cause the function
;			to return all current IDL compiled functions.
;
;	SYS_PROCS:	Setting this keyword will cause the function
;			to return the names of all IDL system (built-in)
;			procedures.
;
;	SYS_FUNCS:	Setting this keyword will cause the function
;			to return the names of all IDL system (built-in)
;			functions.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;	This function returns a string array that normally contains
;	variable data that is in the same format as used by the IDL HELP
;	procedure. The variables in this list are for the routine that
;	called GetHelp(). If other info is requested via keywords, this
;	data is returned.
;
;	Upon an error or if no data is found the function returns an 
;	Null ('') string. 
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	None
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;	None
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;	Due to the diffuculties in determining if a variable is of type
;	associate, the following conditions will result in the variable 
;	being listed as a structure. These conditions are:
;
;	 	o Associate record type is structure.
;		o Associated file is opened for update (openu).
;		o Associate file is not empty.
;
;       Another difference between this routine and the IDL help command
;	is that if a variable is in a common block, the common block name 
;	is not listed next to the variable name. Currently there is no
;	method available to get the common block names used in a routine.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;	This function uses the IDL routine Routine_Names() to get the 
;	names and values of the variables contained in the calling 
;	routine. These values are then placed in a string array using
;	the format of the IDL HELP command. If there are no variables
;	in the calling routine, a null ('') scalar string is returned.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;	To obtain a listing in a help "format" of the variables contained
;	in the current routine you would make the following call:
;
;		HelpData = GetHelp()
;
;	The variable HelpData would be a string array containing the 
;	requested information.

   FUNCTION IS_ASSOC, Unit

; PURPOSE:
;	This function is used to determine if an IDL variable is a
;	Assoc() file variable. This function is needed since there is no
;	built in method for a program to determine if a variable is an
;	associated variable.
;
; OPERATION:
;	This functions depends on several properities of an associate 
;	variable to determine if a variable is one. These properties are:
;
;	   o Size indicates that an associate variable is an array
;	   o N_Elements always returns one for an associate variable
;	   o ON_IOERROR will trap I/O errors that happen during associate
;	     file operations.
;	   o The following command will result in a scalar for a normal
;	     array, an array for an associate variable:
;		 DUM = Var(0)
;	  
; RESTRICTIONS:
;	Due to the diffuculties in determining if a variable is of type
;	associate, the following conditions will result in this function 
;	returning a false. These conditions are:
;
;	 	o Associate record type is structure.
;		o Associated file is opened for update (openu).
;		o Associate file is not empty.
;
; Start by getting the size of the input parameter

  UnitSize = Size(Unit)

; All Assocs are arrays and N_Elements() only returns 1. Check if this 
; variable is a scalar or N_elements() > 1.

  if((UnitSize(0) eq 0)or(N_Elements(Unit) gt 1))then $
     Return, 0  ; no need to continue

; Set up Error handling for input/ouput. This will catch any errors I/O we
; cause with associate variables. This function depends on this trapping.

  On_IOerror, IOERR

; Set the first element of Unit equal to itself. If Unit is an array we
; will continue processing, but if Unit is an associate variable and the 
; file is not open for "update" we will trigger an error which is trapped
; by on_ioerror.

  Unit(0) = Unit(0)

; A single diminsion array would of passed the above test, see if we
; can get the first value of Unit.

  DumVal = Unit(0)
  
; Get the Size of DumVal

  DumSize = Size(DumVal)

; If DumVal is a scalar (So Unit was a 1 dim array) or if DumVal is a 
; struct (so Unit is a struct or assoc to a struct record opened for update)
; return a false.

  if((DumSize(0) eq 0)or(DumSize(N_Elements(DumSize)-2) eq 8))then $
    Return, 0

; The only type of variable that should get here is an associate variable.
; Get the file information for this variable

   UnitStat = Fstat(Unit)

; Make sure that the file is not a tty or has no name

  if((UnitStat.IsAtty eq 1)or(UnitStat.Name eq ''))then  $
       return,0     ;not an assoc

; Anything that gets below this point is an associate variable 

IOERR:

  Return, 1  ; it is an assoc() variable
