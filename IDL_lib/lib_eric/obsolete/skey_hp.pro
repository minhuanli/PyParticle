; NAME:
;	SKEY_HP
;
; PURPOSE:
;	Under Unix, the number of function keys, their names, and the
;	escape sequences they send to the host computer vary
;	enough between various keyboards that IDL cannot be
;	written to understand all keyboards. Therefore, it provides
;	a very general routine named DEFINE_KEY that allows the
;	user to specify the names and escape sequences. This
;	routine uses DEFINE_KEY to enter the keys for the HP 9000
;	series 300 keyboard.
;
;	Note: SKEY_HP is primarily designed to be called by
;	SETUP_KEYS, which attempts to automatically detect the correct
;	keyboard type in use, and define the keys accordingly.
;	Nonetheless, SKEY_HP can be called as a standalone
;	routine.
;
; CATEGORY:
;	Misc.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	SKEY_HP
;
; INPUTS:
;	None.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;  APP_KEYPAD:	Defines escape sequences for the group of keys
;		in the numeric keypad, enabling these keys to be programmed
;		within IDL.
;
;  NUM_KEYPAD:	Disables programmability of the numeric keypad.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;	None.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	None.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;	The definitions for the function keys have been entered, and
;	can be viewed using HELP,/KEYS .
;
;	The upper right-hand group of four keys (at the same height as
;	the function keys) are called "BLANK1" through "BLANK4", since
;	they have no written labels.  Keys defined to have labels beginning
;	with a capital "K" belong to the numeric keypad group.  For example,
;	"K9" refers to keypad key "9".
;
;	Although the HP 9000 series 300 can create both xterm and hpterm
;	windows, IDL supports only user-definable key definitions in xterm
;	windows - hpterm windows use non-standard escape sequences which
;	IDL does not attempt to handle.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;	TJA & AB, July 1990, setup_keys_hp created, and call to setup_keys_hp
;		placed in procedure setup_keys
;	AB, 21 September 1992,renamed from SETUP_KEYS_HP to SKEY_HP to
;		avoid DOS filename limitations.
;	AB, 16 June 1993, The IDL scanner used to treat octal string escapes
;		in a manner similar to the C language, but this ability was
;		removed to make the MS DOS port possible (conflicts with
;		file path specifications). Removed all uses of that here.
